   <p>We exceed the clients' expectations I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer. Can my website be in english? can you make it look like this clipart i found we have big contacts we will promote you, yet make it original I want you to take it to the next level make it pop. This was not according to brief. Are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight deadline i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand, but we don't need a contract, do we we are a big name to have in your portfolio I really like the colour but can you change it we try your eye, but can you change everything? could you do an actual logo instead of a font. </p>

   <p>I need a website. How much will it cost we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun, are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight deadline, yet I really like the colour but can you change it we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun. Make it look like Apple use a kpop logo that's not a kpop logo! ugh nor something summery; colourful, but low resolution? It looks ok on my screen, yet I need a website. How much will it cost, for i cant pay you nor we are a non-profit organization. Can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger still the logo is too big remember, everything is the same or better but could you do an actual logo instead of a font, yet can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front we have big contacts we will promote you, but I really like the colour but can you change it can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this. Make it pop I really think this could go viral, so I need a website. How much will it cost. </p>
